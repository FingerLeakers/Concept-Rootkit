Conceptual rootkit developed as a term project for COSC 439, as taught by Shiva Azadegan of Towson University. 
Makes use of ACK numbers in TCP headers in order to convey commands to compromised host. Both the rootkit and the server handler operate as kernel modules. The command handler serves as an interface for packet crafting with Scapy.
